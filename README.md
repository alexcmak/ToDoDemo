## ToDo Demo

This app is the result of following everything from this 2 year old video to build a Swift UI app that uses MongoDB Realm.
The video from Stephanie is great, in the true sense of a Crash Course, she goes extremely fast.

The official source code for the video is behind a pay wall.

There are a lot of gotchas in building this app:

* When it's time to find the github address for realm, the address given in video is outdated.
* When choosing Realm, you must only choose one.
